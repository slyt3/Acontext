title: "What is Acontext"
description: "Acontext is a Context Data Platform for self-learning Agents"
---

Acontext was born from a simple question:

> “What if an agent could observe, remember, and learn from every interaction it has, just like a human learning skills from its own past?”

Our mission is to give developers the missing foundation for self-evolving agents 
— 
a context data platform that stores, observes, and learns from the agent's interactions. 

## Key Benefits

<Card title="Persistent Context" icon="brain">
Short-term memory

Store conversations and artifacts with text, images, and files across sessions
</Card>

<Card title="Task Observability" icon="eye">
Mid-term memory

Monitor what your agent plans vs. what it actually executes
</Card>

<Card title="Automatic Learning" icon="graduation-cap">
Long-term memory

Agents learn skills from completed tasks without manual training

## How It Works

</Frame>
1. **Store Context**: Your agent's conversations are automatically saved with full context
2. **Extract Tasks**: Acontext identifies when your agent makes plans and breaks down work
3. **Learn Skills**: Successfully completed tasks become reusable knowledge
4. **Apply Learning**: Future agents can search and use these learned skills

<Note>
Think of Acontext as giving your AI agent a library that remembers and learns, just like humans do.
